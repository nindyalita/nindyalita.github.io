              <p>
                As a iOS Developer on this project, I am used SwiftUI, Core Data, and Map Kit for developing this application. SwiftUI is used for constructing the user interface, Core Data for managing user data, and Map Kit is integrated to incorporate interactive maps within the app and to display geographical information. Collaborating with the coding team, I have also used Git for version control and teamwork.

                Memory is a complex and fascinating aspect of human cognition, allowing us to recall and relive our past experiences. When we embark on journeys and explore new places, our memory plays a crucial role in preserving these traveling moments. These moments are often filled with unique sights, sounds, and emotions, and capturing them through various means, such as photographs or journal entries, can greatly aid the remembering process.By actively engaging in the act of capturing moments, we create tangible triggers that connect us to our experiences. Photographs freeze a single moment in time, encapsulating the details that may otherwise fade with the passage of time. When we look at these images, they serve as visual cues, igniting our memory and allowing us to revisit the sights, smells, and feelings of the moment. Similarly, writing in a journal or keeping a travel diary helps in capturing the essence of an experience, documenting the emotions and thoughts that accompanied it. These written accounts provide a vivid record of our adventures and can transport us back to those precise moments, evoking a stronger sense of nostalgia and connection.
                <br><br>
                The act of capturing moments is not solely about preserving the past but also about enhancing our present experience. When we consciously make an effort to observe and document our surroundings, we become more attuned to the details and intricacies of our environment. This heightened awareness allows us to fully immerse ourselves in the present moment, deepening our connection with the places we visit. It is through this process that our memories become richer and more vibrant, as we actively engage with our surroundings and consciously encode the sensory information that will later contribute to our recollection. Memory and traveling moments are intertwined, and capturing these moments serves as a powerful tool for the remembering process. Whether through photographs or journal entries, these tangible triggers enable us to relive our experiences and evoke the emotions associated with them.

              <p>We conducted concept testing to assess and evaluate ideas or concepts for further development. The goal is to understand users' responses and reactions to the concepts. In concept testing, we have three concepts as follows.</p>

              <p>Based on the concept testing conducted with 10 target users, the selected solution concept is "Gamifying traveling experience combining maps, core location. We will also provide suggested activities to explore in each destination." Therefore, the app statement derived from this is: </p>

                <p>In this project, Core Data is utilized to manage data within the application,  encompassing tasks such as storing, retrieving, and displaying user-related  information such as names, wishlists, visited places, and acquired quests.</p>

              <p>In the process of developing this project, a notable challenge involves the conversion of data initially available in JSON (default data) into Core Data Furthermore, as prior experience with Map Kit was lacking, a considerable amount of time was devoted to learning how to detect when a user is at a specific location and have that location promptly recognized. Additionally, modifying the default location pinpoint to a custom one was also a noteworthy undertaking. Furthermore, in the application, users are also able to capture photos from both front and rear cameras within a single screen. However, this presents a challenge as it involves understanding the algorithm for utilizing two cameras simultaneously on one screen.</p>
              

              <h2 style="color:#C5593A; margin-bottom: 10px;">Plans For Future Development</h2>
              <p>The future aspiration for this application is its global utilization. Currently, the app is confined to usage within the Batam region only, limiting its outreach to users outside of the city. Additionally, there is a desire to create unique and distinct quests for each location, differentiating them from one another. In this application, quests obtained are categorized based on place types (beaches, parks, and others), further enhancing the app's experience.</p>
